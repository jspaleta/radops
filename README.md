Radar supporting operating software

This repository was created initially to keep track of the tst-rbsp.py code and changes/edits
to this code.  Software here is not necessarily to include the ROS/RST that is code that actually
runs a SuperDARN radar.  Rather, the code here is tools that help operators program the radars to
operate in certain modes and other assocaited code.
